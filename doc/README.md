BTDX Core
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[BTDX Core]http://bit.bitclouds/ is the original BTDX client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of BTDX transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run BTDX on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- bin/32/bitcloud-qt (GUI, 32-bit) or bin/32/bitcloudd (headless, 32-bit)
- bin/64/bitcloud-qt (GUI, 64-bit) or bin/64/bitcloudd (headless, 64-bit)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bitcloud-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag BTDX-Qt to your applications folder, and then run BTDX-Qt.
